            <h2>Russia says it is ready to halt its invasion of Ukraine “in a moment” if the Ukrainian government meets four conditions, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin
            </h2>

            <h3>In an interview with Reuters</h3>
            <p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia would be willing to halt military operations if, in addition to stopping its own military action, the government of Ukraine agrees to its terms:</p>
            <li>change its constitution to enshrine neutrality between Russia and the West into law</li>
            <li>acknowledge Crimea as belonging to Russia</li>
            <li>recognize the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states.</li>
            <p>Peskov said that Russia’s terms had been laid out and handed over to the Ukrainian delegation during the first two rounds of negotiations between the two countries last week.</p>

            <p>“The objectives are very simple, and they were actually explained by [Putin]. We want to see [a demilitarization of] Ukraine,” he said. “We want to see Ukraine free from Nazi ideology, and Nazi elements,” he added,
             repeating the claim made by Putin that he was seeking the “denazification” of Ukraine. “Also we want to have guarantees that the neutral status of Ukraine is fixed in the Constitution, and also we want to have guarantees
              that weapons being able to change the security balance in Europe cannot be deployed on the territory of [Russia].”
            </p>
            <p>“We have also spoken about how they should recognise that Crimea is Russian territory and that they need to recognise that Donetsk and Lugansk are independent states,” Peskov said of the territorial claims.
                 “This is not us seizing Lugansk and Donetsk from Ukraine,” he added. “Donetsk and Lugansk don’t want to be part of Ukraine. But it doesn’t mean they should be destroyed as a result… For the rest.
                  Ukraine is an independent state that will live as it wants, but under conditions of neutrality.”
                <br>
                “And that’s it. It will stop in a moment,”
